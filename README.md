## 💻 About

I decided to study angular with some back-end integration, and i find [this book](https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-angular-firebase?_pos=1&_sid=a78031fd4&_ss=r) with amazing resolution of best practices with angular, and working with a lot of features from firebase.

Back at 2020 i bought this book and make the project with Angular version 8, now this was updated to Angular version 11 and i decided developed it again at version 12.
